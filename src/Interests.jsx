                    In 2020, my fascination with gaming PCs became a
                    transformative journey that led me into the heart of the
                    tech industry. As I delved into the intricacies of building
                    a high-performance system, powered by an AMD Ryzen 5 3600X
                    6-core processor and a TUF Gaming X570 motherboard, I
                    discovered the dynamic intersection of hardware and
                    software. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 Super, coupled with 32
                    gigs of RAM, unleashed a world of immersive gaming
                    experiences. Managing a colossal 4TB storage capacity
                    allowed me to appreciate the significance of robust
                    computing power. Eager to share my passion, I documented the
                    entire assembly process on YouTube, showcasing the
                    meticulous artistry of crafting a gaming rig. This hands-on
                    experience ignited my curiosity and determination,
                    propelling me towards a career in technology where
                    innovation and performance converge.

                My love for content creation burgeoned in 2013 when I first
                delved into the world of short-form videos, crafting vines that
                sparked my creative journey. Throughout my college years, the
                joy of producing content intensified as I collaborated with a
                group of friends on various video projects. This passion
                seamlessly transitioned into the digital landscape of TikTok,
                Instagram, YouTube, and Twitch. In 2020, amid the challenges the
                year presented, I embraced the world of streaming on platforms
                like Twitch and TikTok. This digital exploration bore fruit as I
                found myself going viral multiple times on TikTok, amassing an
                engaged audience of 47K+ followers. This viral success serves as
                a testament to the resonance of my content and the vibrant
                community that has grown around my creative endeavors. Armed
                with a controller, I ventured into the realms of popular games
                such as Halo, Call of Duty, Smash Brothers, and Apex Legends,
                transforming my love for gaming into engaging and entertaining
                content. The evolution of my content creation journey, from
                vines to the dynamic platforms of today, showcases the enduring
                enthusiasm that fuels my creative endeavors.

                    Basketball has been more than just a pastime for me; it's
                    been a lifelong passion that has shaped my identity. I've
                    been hitting the hardwood since I can remember, playing the
                    game at every stage of my life. During my college years, I
                    took my skills to Nebraska Christian College, a small D3
                    institution, where I made a significant impact. In my
                    freshman year, I proudly earned the Rookie of the Year
                    honors and solidified my position as one of the top players
                    in our division. Beyond the organized games, my love for
                    basketball endures as I continue to lace up my sneakers for
                    pick-up games at local gyms and parks. The NBA holds a
                    special place in my heart, and while my favorite team is the
                    Houston Rockets, my admiration for the game goes back to my
                    childhood, where Derrick Rose was my ultimate basketball
                    hero. His skill and passion for the game inspired me then
                    and continue to influence my love for basketball to this
                    day.
